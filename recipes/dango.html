<h4>How to make Hanami Dango</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Soak the skewers. First, soak the 12 bamboo skewers in water.</li>
  <li>Mix the rice flour and water. Place the rice flours into a bowl and then pour in the hot water. Begin mixing with a spoon, and then when it starts to take shape, use your hands to mold the dango dough together. Add a little more flour or water if needed. The dough should feel like clay or play-doh, but softer.</li>
  <li>Divide the dough. Evenly divide the dango dough into three pieces. Place each one into a separate bowl.</li>
  <li>Color the pink dough. Add 1 drop of pink food coloring to one piece of dough and work it in until there is no more white.</li>
  <li>Color the green dough. Now add 1 teaspoon of water to the matcha powder and mix to make a paste. Then add it to another piece of dough and work it in well. The last piece of dough should remain white.</li>
  <li>Shape the dough into balls. Begin shaping the dough into balls. Each ball should be 20 grams, weighed on a kitchen scale. The recipe makes about 36 balls.</li>
  <li>Cook the white dango balls. Bring a pot of water to a boil and begin cooking the white balls first. Once they rise to the top of the pot, continue cooking them for another 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Cool the dango balls. Once cooked, use a slotted spoon to transfer the steamed dango to a bowl of ice water.</li>
  <li>Repeat with the pink and green balls. Continue this process with the pink and then the green dango to avoid staining the water.</li>
  <li>Skewer the dango. Place the balls on the bamboo skewers, making sure to place the green ones on first, then the white, and the pink ones last. Serve as they are or add a topping.</li>
